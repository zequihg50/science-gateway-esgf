# ESGF Virtual Aggregation Science Gateway

The ESGF Virtual Aggregation Science Gateway provides Virtual Analysis Ready Data (virtual ARD) for datasets hosted in the ESGF, based on the [ESGF Virtual Aggregation](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-18-2461-2025).

## Getting started

Run the science gateway by cliking on the launchers available. The [Binder launcher](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/zequihg50/science-gateway-esgf/HEAD?labpath=notebooks/getting-started.ipynb) allows to run the science gateway on free computational resources provided by [MyBinder.org](https://mybinder.org). The IFCA launcher is only accesible to users registered in the IFCA Hub.

## Notebooks

The [getting started notebook](notebooks/getting-started.ipynb) provides an overview of the science gateway and how to use it. Further notebooks are available in the [notebooks](notebooks) directory.
